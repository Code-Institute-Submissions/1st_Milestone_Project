UX
-----------

_**Pure Ambitions Salon**_

A salon, in a neighborhood in Ã–stermalm, Stockholm, needs an upgrade. 
While making this website, I envisioned the salon's interior and services.

_USER STORIES_

* As a CUSTOMER, I want to get the feel of the salon. 

* As an OWNER, I want customers to book a call.

I received inspiration from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzwOBOjSto8 (Top 5 Web Design Trends 2019). 
I got some ideas that I incorporated in the website like asymetrical layouts and animations on scroll.
