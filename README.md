UX
-----------

###Pure Ambitions Salon

A salon, in a neighborhood in Ã–stermalm, Stockholm, needs an upgrade. 
While making this website, I envisioned the salon's interior their services.

###USER STORIES

-As a CUSTOMER, I want to have a feel of the salon's interior and services. 
(I thought about focusing on this because almost all salons offer the same services. 
What should set this salon apart is how its website is presented.)

-As an OWNER, I want customers to book a call.
(By reflecting the salon throught the website, customers can become more interested in booking a call
and leaving their contact details.)

I received inspiration from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzwOBOjSto8 (Top 5 Web Design Trends 2019). 
I got some ideas that I incorporated in the website like asymetrical layouts and animations on scroll.
